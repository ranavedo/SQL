#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) =6
;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) =6
AND Product='iPhone'
;

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS customers
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) =6
;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) =6
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product,
SUM(price) AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
sum(Quantity), 
product, 
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101' 
GROUP BY product
;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT
count(distinct Cust.acctnum),
avg(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers Cust
ON Feb.orderID = Cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2 
AND length(orderid) = 6 
;

#8. How many products were sold in Los Angeles in February and how many of each were sold?
