# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#First I determined which tracks were most popular at the time based on popularity and who they belonged to.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

#Then I filtered to know who the most popular artists were based on the SUM popularity of the songs each artist currently had on the chart.
SELECT artist_name, SUM(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY SUM(popularity) desc
LIMIT 10
;

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
WITH Avgpop AS (
SELECT s.artist_name,
AVG(s.popularity) AS avg_pop
FROM Spotifydata AS s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT artist_name,
avg_pop,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM Avgpop
WHERE avg_pop>= 90
;
